# Node Operators

Node Operators are responsible for providing hardware services to the network in exchange for yield. The protocol balances Depositors' funds evenly between all Node Operators in a non-custodial manner. That is, they never have access to funds other than their compensation from the protocol for this service. Although nearly 100% of a Node Operator's responsibilities are automated, they are also paid in relation to their performance, so there is always an incentive to be effective.

Node Operators are paid in xrETH, meaning they are also Depositors.
