# xRPL

An immutable ERC20 token which users may mint and burn in exchange for RPL using a specific exchange rate as described by the xRPL Oracle. All RPL received by this contract is forwarded to the Deposit Pool, and when the burn function is called, the Deposit Pool should supply the RPL. If the Deposit Pool does not contain enough RPL for a depositor to redeem their xRPL for the appropriate quantity of RPL, then the burn function call should be reverted.
